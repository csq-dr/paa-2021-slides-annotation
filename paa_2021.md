# Slide 1: Title
_Presentation given at the [Population Association of America (PAA) Annual Meeting 2021](https://www.populationassociation.org/paa-2021/home)._

Hello, my name is Chuchu Wei  from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Iâ€™ll be presenting the joint with [Leontine Alkema](https://leontinealkema.github.io/alkema_lab/). 

# Slide 2: Background

Our motivating question is how to estimate contraceptive prevalence (CP) for all countries in the world using self-reported use from national level surveys like demographic health surveys (DHS).

We has proposed a Bayesian model called the family planning estimation model to estimate prevalence in all countries.

Here are some examples of observed self-reported usage of modern contraception over time in Burundi and Colombia, two countries at different stages of their contraceptive transition.

The estimates from FPEM are added to the country plots, with solid lines referring to point estimates and dashed lines to 80% credible intervals.

In FPEM, we distinguish between a process model and a data model. A process model is used to describe true prevalence and how it changes with time and allows for estimation and projections to years without data.

In this talk I will focus on the data model that describes how data related to true prevalence.
