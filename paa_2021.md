# Slide 1: Title
_Presentation given at the [Population Association of America (PAA) Annual Meeting 2021](https://www.populationassociation.org/paa-2021/home)._

Hello, my name is Chuchu Wei from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Iâ€™ll be presenting this joint work with [Leontine Alkema](https://leontinealkema.github.io/alkema_lab/). 

# Slide 2: Background

Our motivating question is how to estimate contraceptive prevalence (CP) for all countries in the world using self-reported use from national level surveys like demographic health surveys (DHS).

We has proposed a Bayesian model called the family planning estimation model to estimate prevalence in all countries.

Here are two examples of observed self-reported usage of modern contraception over time in Ghana and Nepal, two countries at different stages of their contraceptive transition.

<!-- Here are two examples of observed self-reported usage of modern contraception over time in Burundi and Colombia, two countries at different stages of their contraceptive transition. -->

The estimates from FPEM are added to the country plots, with solid lines referring to point estimates and dashed lines to 80% credible intervals.

# Slide 3: Country-level estimation of FPEM

In FPEM, we distinguish between a process model and a data model. A process model is used to describe true prevalence and how it changes with time and allows for estimation and projections to years without data.

In this talk I will focus on the data model that describes how data related to true prevalence.

On this slide I present the FPEM data model both in equations as well as visually.

Starting with the equations on the left:
Let y refer to observed mCPR and theta to the unknown true mCPR.  In FPEM, explained here in simplified form to focus on the main points, we assume that on the logit-scale, the transformed yu's are normally distribyted with mean theta and a variance that is the sum of a sampkling and a non-sampling variance. This data model is motivated by the fact that obs are obtained in a survey and thus subject to sampling error, and the assumption that typically, data are subject to additional errors called non-sampling error.
No info of non-sampling error was available at the time FPEM was developed, hence NSE was estimated  and for modern use it is around 10%.
The relation between observed data y and estimates for the true theta based on the fpem data model is visualized on the left. We present this relationship as the bayesian estimates we would obtain for theta for an observed value of theta, when assuming a uniform 0-1 prior on theta, so assuming any value for theta is equally likely, such that the estimates are driven by the data model.
We see in this graph that in the FPEM data model, non=-sampling errors are assumed to increase uncertainty when prevalence is close to 0.5 but decrease to zero as prevalence is close to 0 or 1.
Is this kind of relationship reasonable? To assess that question, we considered external data on non-sampling errors in self-reported use
