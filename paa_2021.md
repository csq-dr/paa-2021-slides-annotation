# Slide 1: Title
_Presentation given at the [Population Association of America (PAA) Annual Meeting 2021](https://www.populationassociation.org/paa-2021/home)._

Hello, my name is Chuchu Wei from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Iâ€™ll be presenting this joint work with [Leontine Alkema](https://leontinealkema.github.io/alkema_lab/). 

# Slide 2: Introduction

In this study, our motivating question is how to estimate contraceptive prevalence (CP) for all countries in the world using self-reported use from national level surveys like demographic health surveys (DHS).

We has proposed a Bayesian model called the family planning estimation model to estimate prevalence in all countries.

Here are two examples of observed self-reported usage of modern contraception over time in Ghana and Nepal, two countries at different stages of their contraceptive transition.

The estimates from FPEM are added to the country plots, with solid lines referring to point estimates and dashed lines to 80% credible intervals.

# Slide 3: How is the data used in FPEM?

In FPEM, we distinguish between a process model and a data model. A process model is used to describe true prevalence and how it changes with time and allows for estimation and projections to years without data. In this talk, I will focus on the data model that describes how data related to true prevalence.

Let $y$ refer to observed mCPR and $\theta$ to the unknown true mCPR, we assume that the logit-transformed $y$'s are normally distributed with mean equals to logit-transformed $\theta$, and a variance that is the sum of sampling variance $\text{logit}.s^2$, and a non-sampling variance $\tau^2$. 

This data model is motivated by the fact that observed $y$ are obtained in a survey and thus subject to sampling error, and an typical assumption that data are subject to additional non-sampling error. No info of non-sampling error was available at the time FPEM was developed, hence NSE was estimated around 10% for mCPR.
The graph on the right is the relationship between observed $y$ and estimates of $\theta$ based on the data model. We present this relationship as the Bayesian estimates when assuming a uniform prior $U(0,1)$ on $\theta$. So assuming any value for $\theta$ is equally likely.

In this graph of the data model assumption, non-sampling errors are assumed to increase uncertainty when prevalence is close to 0.5 but decrease to zero as prevalence is close to 0 or 1.

Is this kind of relationship reasonable? To assess that question, we considered external data on non-sampling errors in self-reported usage.

# Slide 4: What if we observed some non-sampling error?

In the previous slide, we have shown that there is no particular assumption of the non-sampling error $\tau$ in the data model.  However, what if we have some evidence of the non-sampling error, for example, the non-sampling error in the form of misclassification error? 

And there are two studies that collect follow-up data for DHS of Ghana and Nepal. From these two post-survey studies, we summarize the misclassification error in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Then the question is, what is the data model looks like with such evidence of non-sampling error?
